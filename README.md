We are waiting for your answer! Simply submit it by sending in a pull request with your own algorithm.
# Setup
```
git clone git@github.com:renuo/nearest-vowel.git
cd nearest-vowel
bin/setup
```
# Task
Your task is, to write an algorithm that can find the nearest vowel of every letter in the String. The solution should be
